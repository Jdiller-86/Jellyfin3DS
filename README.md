# Jellyfin3DS

Jellyfin3DS is an unofficial, direct Jellyfin client for Nintendo 3DS built with [PocketJS](https://github.com/pocket-stack/pocketjs). It browses libraries, seasons, and episodes; searches; resumes videos; and reports playback progress. The 400×240 upper screen carries video and context while the 320×240 touch screen carries navigation and controls in a theme inspired by the native Nintendo 3DS System Settings UI.

**No companion computer, phone, proxy, or Jellyfin plugin is needed after installation.** The 3DS connects to the Jellyfin server itself. The on-device implementation uses libcurl for the Jellyfin API, requests a constrained H.264/AAC MPEG-TS transcode, demuxes and decodes it with the FFmpeg/MVD path from [bogocat/jellyfin-3ds](https://github.com/bogocat/jellyfin-3ds), and sends audio to NDSP.

**Video requires a New Nintendo 3DS, New 3DS XL/LL, or New 2DS XL.** Original 3DS/3DS XL/2DS systems do not provide the MVD H.264 decoder. This remains an experimental client and has not yet been certified on physical hardware.

## Install with FBI

On the 3DS, open **FBI → Remote Install → Scan QR Code**, then scan this code. It resolves to the `Jellyfin3DS.cia` asset in the versioned `v0.2.0` GitHub Release.

Direct URL: <https://github.com/Jdiller-86/Jellyfin3DS/releases/download/v0.2.0/Jellyfin3DS.cia>

FBI needs anonymous access to the release asset. If this repository is private, use the manual download below until the repository or a binary-only release mirror is public.

## Manual install

Download the `Jellyfin3DS-install` artifact from a successful **Build 3DS homebrew** GitHub Actions run. It contains:

- `3ds/Jellyfin3DS/Jellyfin3DS.3dsx` for Homebrew Launcher
- `cias/Jellyfin3DS.cia` for FBI and a HOME Menu entry
- the FBI QR image, installation instructions, and SHA-256 checksums

See [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for SD-card placement, first-run sign-in, controls, and troubleshooting. A `.pocket` file is a PocketJS runtime package, not a Homebrew Launcher or FBI install file.

## Develop

```sh
git clone --branch feat/pocketjs-client --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Jdiller-86/Jellyfin3DS.git
cd Jellyfin3DS
bun run setup
bun run test
bun run build:guest       # guest JS, assets, and admitted .pocket package
bun run native:deps       # pinned 3DS portlibs, CA bundle, and FFmpeg (Docker)
bun run build             # .3dsx and .cia; Docker + pinned Rust required
bun run package           # SD/FBI distribution layout
```

CI uses Bun 1.4.2, PocketJS commit `a5a85356e172db8a32aefa983ee1259f60406f69`, bogocat/jellyfin-3ds commit `05bfa02f131d13f163bc7091d18af3b5b84f0820`, Rust `nightly-2026-07-02`, the PocketJS-pinned devkitPro container digest, and the reference client's pinned FFmpeg fork revision. The native dependencies are cached between CI runs.

## Security and storage

- The password exists only in the first-run UI and login request. It is cleared after the request and never written to the SD card.
- The server URL, username, persistent device ID, Jellyfin user ID, and access token are stored at `/3ds/Jellyfin3DS/config.json` so the app can reconnect. Signing out removes the access token and user ID.
- Tokens travel in HTTP headers, not stream URLs. Redirects are disabled so an authorization header cannot be forwarded to another host.
- HTTPS certificate and hostname verification use the CA bundle embedded at build time. A private or self-signed certificate must be trusted by that bundle; otherwise use plain HTTP only on a network you trust.
- The client accepts only `http://` and `https://` server URLs and bounds API responses, requests, item names, and five-row result pages for 3DS memory limits.

## Current scope

- Default video and audio tracks; no subtitle picker or burn-in, media-version picker, live TV, DRM, offline downloads, music-only player, or stereoscopic playback.
- Jellyfin transcodes to H.264 Baseline Level 3.1, AAC stereo, MPEG-TS, at up to 400×240. Server transcoding must be enabled for the user.
- Reverse-proxy base paths such as `https://media.example/jellyfin` are supported. HTTP redirects are not.
- Browse remains available while a video runs on the upper screen; SELECT returns to player controls.
- Progress is reported on playback start, pause/resume, about every five seconds, and stop. Power loss can lose the latest position.

`app/` contains the Solid/PocketJS interface. `native/` implements the bounded on-device provider and media adapter. `scripts/native-host.ts` stages the pinned reference decoder into PocketJS's 3DS host without modifying either submodule.
